Hi there! Welcome to my little bubble on the net. 

I make holograms using a combination of geometric computer vision, deep learning, and classical image processing.
In my previous lives, among [other things](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bm4orewAAAAJ), I've worked on:
 - [interpretable](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8320856) machine learning via sparse [graph signal processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7763882)
 - virtual reality controllers for standalone headsets using low-cost, low-power sensors
 - computational 3D imaging based on [time-of-flight](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6738075/) of light

I received my [Ph.D.](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/ndownloader/files/12255548) from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://cmu.edu/) in the Electrical & Computer Engineering department in 2018.
I was advised by Prof. [Jos√© M.F. Moura](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/).
I received my B.S. and [M.Eng.](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/85609/870686410-MIT.pdf?sequence=2) degrees in Electrical Science and Engineering from [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://mit.edu/) in 2013.
I was advised by [Vivek K. Goyal](https://www.rle.mit.edu/stir/).

I enjoy playing tennis, [violin](http://www.youtube.com/user/changethewhirled/), [chess](https://lichess.org/@/meihem), and other [board](http://catanuniverse.com/en/game/) [games](http://dominion.games) at an amateur level.
I fold [origami](projects/1_paper) and dabble in other miscellaneous [artsy](projects/6_misc) media.
I also more recently started [jumping](projects/3_trick), picked up [rock climbing](https://touchstoneclimbing.com/dogpatch-boulders/), and got into [windsurfing](http://cal-sailing.org/).
